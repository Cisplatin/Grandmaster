# Grandmaster

Grandmaster is a chess application written in C++. Still a work in progress,
and so there is little to show right now.

## Features:

```Bash
add <name>         # Adds new player with name <name>
remove <name>      # Removes the player with name <name>
game <name> <name> # Starts a game between the two given players
```

## To-do:
- Make an actual Makefile
- Implement ability to load/save games (.PGN games)
- Start games with normal layout by default
- Implement ability to load/save players
